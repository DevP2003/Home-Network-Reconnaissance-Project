# Home-Network-Reconnaissance-Project

This project simulates a real-world internal reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment, conducted on a personal home network using **Nmap**. The goal was to discover active hosts, enumerate open ports and services, and analyze each device's exposure from a security perspective â€” similar to what a junior SOC analyst or penetration tester might do in a corporate network environment.


## Tools Used:

- **Kali Linux** (running in UTM on 2020 MacBook Pro)
- **Nmap 7.94**
- **Wi-Fi Subnet Range**: '192.168.X.X/24'


## Project Goals:

- Discover all active running hosts on my local network.
- Identify ports, status, services, and OS fingerprints on each device.
- Assess potential risks, exposure, or weak points.
- Document results in a report format.
